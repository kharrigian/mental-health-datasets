# Mental Health Datasets

The information below is an evolving list of data sets (primarily from electronic/social media) that have been used to model mental-health phenomena. The raw data (with additional columns) can be found in `data_sources.xlsx`. If you are an author of any of these papers and feel that anything is misrepresented, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at kharrigian@jhu.edu.

For an overview of existing datasets, please consider reading our paper [*On the State of Social Media Data for Mental Health Research*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05233).

## Contributing

We hope this repository becomes the central knowledge base for researchers working at the intersection of NLP and mental health. However, we cannot achieve this goal without the support of the community.

You can view our backlog of literature that needs annotation [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KI-LlcTw5YCS0iuPEkCUD29z0XdZnqw91iWxyY8Y-jw/edit?usp=sharing). To annotate one of these papers, or to annotate a paper we haven't yet identified, please begin by updating the backlog to note that you are taking responsibility for a paper's annotation. After, you can use our [standardized annotation form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgN5pPivsNvWBsO3YZBx8H91nrBHTd0bWI2Ao1X9KPhlUWsQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to make a submission that will be reviewed and published within the main directory.
